## Didichuxing machine learning competition. (Also Udacity Course Project)

All works are completed with datascientist workbench.
best score 0.23....did not make it to the final round, roughly top 20%.

1. Process data using pandas dataframe.
   - datascientist workbench somehow does not allow importing modules (bug? reported to IBM.)
2. Code shown here is the snippet for building NN with tensorflow, did not get a chance to implement CNN.

3. Complete model involves ensembling of Logistic regression, a few different NN and XGB. Stored in private Repo due to Udacity course requirement. 


## Reflection:
Very interesting topic, traffic is a huge issue in modern cities. By predicting supply amd demand gap, car sharing companies could utilize their resources more wisely and therefore help us riders eventually.

Lesson learned: data > algorithm....

To become a good machine learning engineer, one has to be a data science expert first...getting clean, large volume of data is the hardest thing. When you have sufficient clean training data, even simple regression model would give you ok result....
