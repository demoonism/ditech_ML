## Didichuxing machine learning competition.

All works are completed with datascientist workbench.
best score 0.23....did not make it to the final round. 

1. process data using pandas dataframe.
   - datascientist workbench somehow does not allow importing modules (bug? reported to IBM.)
2. building NN with neural net, did not get a chance to implement CNN.


## Reflection:
Very interesing topic, traffic is a huge issue in modern cities. By predicting supply amd demand gap, car sharing companies could utilize their resources more wisely and therefore help us riders eventually.

This is my first attempt in machine learning competitions. lesson learned: data > algorithm....

To become a good machine learning engineer, one has to be a data science expert first...getting clean, large volume of data is the hardest thing. When you have sufficient clean training data, even simple regression model would give you ok result....
